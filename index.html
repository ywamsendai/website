IMPORTANT: When building site with Jekyll, use this command (use bash on windows):
JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll build

Please let's have a culture of attribution, especially with pictures.

The way I do it:

1 - Use title attribute to display CC info on mouse_hover, example:
		title= "Bridges Not Walls/Credit: Colin Hattersley/Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0"

2 - Link to original image with attribute target="blank", full example:
 		<a href="https://flic.kr/p/Rd94j6" target="blank"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="Bridges not Walls" title= "Bridges Not Walls/Credit: Colin Hattersley/Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0"/></a>

        <div class="text-block text-bold padding-top">
          North-East Japan (or Tohoku) is a large, beautiful rural region that is known for its delicious fruit. Yet this region is also home to few Christians. There are many towns and villages here with no church or missionary presence. We desire this region to bare much spiritual fruit! In Japan, and this region in particular, Jesus’ words definitely ring true: The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. (Matthew 9.37)<br><br>
		  North-East Japan was also hit by the major 2011 earthquakes and tsunami which killed around 18,000 people and destroyed whole towns and cities along the coast. Today, the people are rebuilding their lives. It will take generations for the sense of loss and pain felt by the people here to disappear.

		<h3 class="padding-top color-green">Authentic Japanese Christianity</h3>
        <div class="text-block text-bold padding-top">
          Japanese identity is deeply entangled with Shinto and Buddhist culture and customs, being especially strong in rural Tohoku. Because Christianity is relatively new to Japan and that it often looks and feels Western, the Japanese tend to view it as being a “Western religion”. Its common to hear someone say “I really like Jesus, but I am Japanese.” We long for this to change!
		  <br><br>
		  We believe that for the gospel to truly take root in Japan, we need to communicate the gospel in a Japanese way. For this reason, we as a community will be intentional in functioning bilingually in English and Japanese – doing our best to be culturally fluent. All foreign staff will be expected to study the Japanese language and culture. As well as this, we as a community will creatively explore ways in which we can express worship and evangelism in authentically Japanese ways. We would also love Japanese people to join our community as staff!

        <div class="text-block text-bold padding-top">
          With a population of over a million people, Sendai is the largest city in North-East Japan. We desire to see a community of people established in this city that will love God and make Him known to the 99% of the population that don’t yet know Him. Please pray for us, partner with us or even consider joining us!
		  <br><br>
		  As Tohoku is a large region that is mostly unreached by the gospel, we want to see a YWAM community pioneered in all of the six prefectures. Therefore, it is our heart to not only grow as a community in Sendai, but also to champion and release our members to spread God’s work through YWAM in surrounding areas from an early stage. Many smaller YWAM communities are more effective than just one large base!

              We hope to help projects use our modular system to test their innovative smart contracts and UIs with real money in a low risk environment. Imagine starting a charity to help alleviate homelessness in your hometown while alpha testing an experimental decentralized governance system you plan to use in your project.
            <br><br>
              With Giveth, you can have live smart contract testing while making the world a better place! And because of Giveth's open-source nature, if a decentralized governance protocol or any other smart contract is used on the platform successfully it can easily achieve network effect and be utilized by other DACs (Decentralized Altruistic Communities) to aid in their cause.

        Youth With A Mission is a global movement of Christians from many cultures, age groups, and Christian traditions, dedicated to serving Jesus throughout the world. Also known as YWAM (pronounced “WHY-wham”), we unite in a common purpose to know God and to make Him known.
		<br><br>
		Back when we began in 1960, our main focus was to get youth involved in missions. Today, we still focus on youth, and we also involve people aged 9 to 90.
