# YWAM Sendai website
The YWAM Sendai website is using Jekyll, Netlify, and Bootstrap 4.

## Run your own installation

1 - Star the repo and fork it

2 - Clone your repo

3 - Install Jekyll:

Jekyll requires Ruby, this specific build also requires some additional packages (these may change as well).

Please refer to the official Jekyll Documentation for installing Jekyll:

[GNU/Linux, Unix, or macOS](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

[Windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/)

3 - Run ```bundle install``` to install additional dependencies

4 - Run ```jekyll serve``` to initiate a local build and run a local webserver.

5 - If you run into problems because your version of Jekyll is newer then ours, consider running ```bundle exec jekyll serve```

*Congratulations!* You can now edit the source files and immediately see the changes in your browser (should be [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)).


## Technologies used
* Created from ```jekyll new```
* added Bootstrap 4 via CDN


This site was created with the giveth.io website as a base, because its pretty awesome and I love what they are doing in general! Their decentralised model of functioning and making the world better is something we can learn from.
