Contributions are actively encouraged!

IMPORTANT: When building site with Jekyll, use this command (use bash on windows):
JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll build

Please let's have a culture of attribution, especially with pictures.

The way I do it:

1 - Use title attribute to display CC info on mouse_hover, example:
		title= "Bridges Not Walls/Credit: Colin Hattersley/Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0"

2 - Link to original image with attribute target="blank", full example:
 		<a href="https://flic.kr/p/Rd94j6" target="blank"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="Bridges not Walls" title= "Bridges Not Walls/Credit: Colin Hattersley/Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0"/></a>

    <h3>Why donate to YWAM Sendai?</h3>
    <ul class="flex-row d-flex features">
      <li>
        <h5>Japan is not reached by the Gospel </h5>
        <p>
          Many people donâ€™t realise that Japan is one of the least evangelised nations on earth. Around 1% of the population know Jesus. Japan is often overlooked by people wishing to support missions because it is not a poor country. Yet the spiritual needs are great. Your donations help us to meet the expenses of reaching the lost and bringing His Kingdom to Japan.

        <h5>How the donations would be used </h5>
        <p>
          Here are some examples of our financial needs:
		  <ol>
		  <li>Outreach events.</li>
		  <li>Computers, office, musical and technical equipment.</li>
		  <li>Resources, promotion and material costs of developing more ministries to serve students, youth at risk, children and orphans, human trafficking victims, and those suffering under social injustice, to name just a few of our pioneering efforts.</li>
		  <li>Outreach vehicles.</li>
		  <li>We would like to purchase office and meeting space.</li>
		  <li>To support the vision to have other new missional communities pioneered throughout Tohoku and Japan.</li>
		  <li>To help support Japanese people to join YWAM. There is not yet a strong church culture to financially support young missionaries in Japan, and this is a large barrier for many Japanese to join the mission field.</li>
		  </ol>
